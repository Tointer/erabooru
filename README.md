# Erabooru Development Guide

This repository contains a Go backend with a SvelteKit frontend. During development you can run the UI with the Vite dev server for hot reloading while using the existing backend services. Bleve is used for search indexing, and an ent hook keeps the index synchronized with the Postgres metadata.

## Easiest way to run
You will need Docker and env that can run curl (It can be ran on Windows from git bash)
Run `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/era-things/erabooru/main/deploy/quickstart.sh | bash`
* It will use quickstart script from deploy/quistart.sh
* It will use `docker-compose.pull.yml` to run everything from pre-built containers

## DEV Prerequisites
- Linux or WSL2 with networkingMode=mirrored
- Docker
- Go
- Node.js and npm
- make

## Source init
Run `make prepare` after cloning to init node, go, and generate Ent ORM schema

## DEV launch
Run `make dev` 
* It will create .env file out of .env.example if there is none, you can redact it if needed
* It will run Air for Go hot realoading and Vite dev server for web hot reloading
* It will launch additional helper container to inspect postgre and bleve db
* The UI will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Prod source launch
Run `make prod`
* It will create .env file out of .env.example if there is none, you can redact it if needed
